## Get going quickly 🏃‍♀️💨

You can get off the ground running with Astro PWA by creating a new Astro projects with one of the starters.

### The SPA starter

The SPA starter gives you a basic Astro SPA with some simple examples of sharing state using Astro components or your framework of choice.

Create a project by running:

```
npm create astro -- --template astro-pwa/starter-spa
```

> **Protip**: the SPA template uses the [SPA component](/en/concepts/spa) and [Stores](/en/concepts/stores) along with [Astro Islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) to make everything possible

### The server starter

The server starter gives you a basic server-rendered application using only Astro components!

Create a project by running:

```
npm create astro -- --template astro-pwa/starter-server
```

> **Protip**: the SPA template uses the [Frame component](/en/concepts/frame) and [Stores](/en/concepts/stores) to make everything possible

### The PWA starter

The PWA starter gives you a taste of all of Astro PWA's features, giving you a fully server-rendered SPA using Astro components or your framework of choice.

Create a project by running:

```
npm create astro -- --template astro-pwa/starter-server
```

> **Protip**: the SPA template uses the [SPA component](/en/concepts/spa) to make your application snappy, the [Frame component](/en/concepts/frame) to make your application secure, [Stores](/en/concepts/stores) to share state between server and client, and [Forms](/en/concepts/forms) to create secure user inputs.
